## üë©‚Äçüé® Welcome!! to the UA Buchtel College of Arts & Sciences Organization for Web Designers & Editors! üé®

### Main Repository
https://github.com/UA-Buchtel-College-Design/uakron.edu-bcas

**The primary purpose is to track issues through our main repository called `uakron.edu-bcas`, there is no code here to program with.**

Our repository `uakron.edu-bcas` shall include some documentation of the system to get a new designer started, but it will mostly be used for **issues.** Issues in the `uakron.edu-bcas` repository allow for assigning REDESIGNS, ADDITIONS, and FIXES to members of this organization.

### ISSUE TYPES:

* REDESIGN: This is a **large project,** it involves the redesign of one or more full pages in the domain. (Ex. Sociology Dept. Redesign)
* ADDITION: This is a **medium-sized project,** it can involve the redesign, addition, OR SUBTRACTION of one or more dotCMS components inside of one or more pages.
* FIX: This is a **small-sized project,** it can range anywhere from a typo on a page to redesigning a component. HOWEVER, it should not affect other components much at all, or the page design itself.

Prior to the start of this organization, Lisa Craig (BCAS Director of Communications) kept all projects managed through Outlook email forwarding & replies. This GitHub organization may be a bit of getting used to, but it allows us to centralize documents & conversation around projects. 

#### Feel free to create a new repository if you have a large project such as a redesign and store files in it, such as media or design documentation.
